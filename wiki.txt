The idea of a dumb network is that the endpoints of a network are generally where the intelligence lies, and that the network itself generally leaves the management and operation of communication to the end user. In 2013 the software company MetroTech Net, Inc. (MTN) coined the term <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dumb_Wave" title="Dumb Wave">Dumb Wave</a> which is the modern application of the Dumb Pipe concept to the ubiquitous wireless network.</p>, <p>The end-to-end principle is a principle of network design, first laid out explicitly in the 1981 conference paper <i>End-to-end arguments in system design</i> by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jerome_H._Saltzer" title="Jerome H. Saltzer">Jerome H. Saltzer</a>, <a href="/wiki/David_P._Reed" title="David P. Reed">David P. Reed</a>, and <a href="/wiki/David_D._Clark" title="David D. Clark">David D. Clark</a>. The principle states that, whenever possible, <a href="/wiki/Communications_protocol" title="Communications protocol">communications protocol</a> operations should be defined to occur at the end-points of a communications system, or as close as possible to the resource being controlled. According to the end-to-end principle, protocol features are only justified in the lower layers of a system if they are a performance optimization; hence, TCP retransmission for reliability is still justified, but efforts to improve TCP reliability should stop after peak performance has been reached. They argued that reliable systems tend to require end-to-end processing to operate correctly, in addition to any processing in the intermediate system. They pointed out that most features in the lowest level of a communications system have costs for all higher-layer clients, even if those clients do not need the features, and are redundant if the clients have to re-implement the features on an end-to-end basis. This leads to the model of a minimal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dumb_network" title="Dumb network">dumb network</a> with smart terminals, a completely different model from the previous paradigm of the smart network with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dumb_terminal" title="Dumb terminal">dumb terminals</a>. Because the end-to-end principle is one of the central design principles of the Internet, and because the practical means for implementing data discrimination violate the end-to-end principle, the principle often enters discussions about net neutrality.
