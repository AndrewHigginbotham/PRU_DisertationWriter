started
utter chaos

put together as a team, broke down the problem
the things we need
    1) be able to search
    2) get and store! text from individual pages
    3) parse the text
    4) put the text together
    5) display the text

what went wrong?
almost everything

ideas
what worked out-
    able to use python libraries
    read a file
    put out the text

    initially, going to grab a paragraph from sources and shove them together
    hopefully coherent
    couldn't really get anything

the next approaches
web search
everything we tried failed
    first, google API's
    one was deprecated circa 2014
    the other only searches domains you give it
    and even then only minimal results
    other groups tried as well
    then went and looked for other web search API's
    Yahoo discontinued theirs, the new one is for advertisement analysis
    Bing required a membership and a bunch of other things without any reassurance it would work

then, we decided we would do one page and then crawl down
found scrapy, a web tool for python
does web crawling down layers from a specified page

except... we couldn't crawl anywhere
we crawled no pages after spending 3 hours trying to figure it out

so, we can't get sources
we could hard code a bunch of sites

what we ended up doing was just taking what we had and writing a custom parser
then, we took that and put it out as an HTML page
except, python script to do it for us when parser had too many bugs to solve at midnight

threw sources at the bottom with some CSS and called it a night

what we learned
it's really hard to learn new languages and explore stuff in one night
how to work as a team
how to work through adversity
how to explain why we failed
how to make powerpoints on very short notice
